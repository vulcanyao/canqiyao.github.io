Biography
------
I am a final-year PhD student with Department of Mehcanical and Energy Engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), and work with [Prof. Zaiyue Yang](http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/yangzy3/en/), [Dr. Shibo Chen](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/chensb/en/). I visited the Control Systems Technology group, Department of Mechanical Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), Eindhoven, Netherlands, in 2022, and worked with [Prof. Mauro Salazar](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=0Z9zTYwAAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my BEng in Electrical Engineering from Changsha University of Science and Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Yuanyuan Wang](https://www.csust.edu.cn/dq/info/1083/4065.htm).
